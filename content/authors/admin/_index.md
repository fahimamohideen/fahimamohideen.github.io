I am a social psychologist studying topics at the intersection of social and positive psychology for individual and collective good. My research broadly examines well-being within everyday life and in relation to sociopolitical contexts like injustice. For example, I have tested predictors and outcomes of collective action as it relates to well-being using a multi-method approach and across various social issues such as racial injustice, gun violence, and participants' self-selected issues. In a second line of work, I have studied how people perceive, pursue, and experience meaning in their lives. 

An integral part of my approach involves employing a diverse methodological toolkit integrating survey, longitudinal, experimental, daily diary, and experience sampling methods, and targeting generalizability by recruiting diverse samples from specialized populations and across the world. 

My long-term goal is to utilize my research and analytical skills to understand and address the psychological and behavioral underpinnings of real-world issues for societal benefit.
